          My name is Patrick DePuydt. I'm an artist. There, I said it. But,
          really, I'm just a SouthWest kid trying to make it, ya know? I like to
          fill up my coffee cup half-way. (It's not that weird). I want to be a
          kid when I grow up. Linkin Park. I am the definition of the cutting
          edge of Redneck Bro Science. I should have never stopped drawing
          dinosaurs, that was a big mistake. I belive in magic, *if* (and only
          if) the music is groovy. I believe code is written by humans and
          should readable by humans; good code should be clear before it is ever
          clever, no matter how good or bad it is. I belive in the 2nd Law of
          Thermodynamics which subsequently compells me to belive that design
          patterns should be biodegradable before they are beautiful. As for me?
          The woods are lovely, dark and deep, but I have promises to keep. And
          miles to go before I sleep. And miles to go before I sleep.
