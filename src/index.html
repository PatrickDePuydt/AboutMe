          My name is Patrick DePuydt. I'm an artist. There, I said it. But,
          really, I'm just a SouthWest kid trying to make it, ya know? I like to
          fill up my coffee cup half-way. (It's not that weird). I want to be a
          kid when I grow up. Linkin Park. I fancy myself on the cutting edge of
          Redneck Bro Science. I should have never stopped drawing dinosaurs,
          that was a big mistake. I belive in magic, *if* (and only if) the
          music is groovy. I believe code is written by humans and should
          readable by humans. Good code should be clear before it is ever
          clever, no matter how good or bad it is. I belive in the 2nd Law of
          Thermodynamics which subsequently compells me to belive that design
          patterns should be biodegradable before they are beautiful. You
          probably already know how to contact me butttt... if can't find my
          email it's
          <a href="mailto:prdepuydt@gmail.com">prdepuydt@gmail.com</a> The woods
          are lovely, dark and deep, but I have promises to keep.
